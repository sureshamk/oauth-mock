# Active Context: Initial Project Discovery

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on fixing the test cases for the mock OAuth2 server.

## Recent Changes

- Updated the `test/auth.test.js` file to use the correct `redirect_uri`.
- Ran the tests and confirmed that they are all passing.

## Next Steps

- Update the `progress.md` file to reflect the test case fixes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The initial documentation is based on an analysis of the file structure and the `README.md`. Further details may be added after a more in-depth code review.
