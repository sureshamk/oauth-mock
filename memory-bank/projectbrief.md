# Project Brief: Mock Google OAuth2 Server

## Core Requirements and Goals

The primary goal of this project is to provide a mock Google OAuth2 server that can be used for local development and testing purposes, specifically for applications using Passport.js for authentication.

This server should simulate the essential OAuth2 endpoints required for an authentication flow, including authorization, token exchange, and user information retrieval.

## Scope

The scope of this project is to provide a self-contained, easy-to-run mock server that mimics the behavior of Google's OAuth2 service. It is not intended to be a full-featured OAuth2 provider but rather a tool to facilitate development and testing of client applications.

Key features within the scope are:
- Mock user management through a configuration file.
- OAuth client management through a configuration file.
- Docker-based setup for easy deployment.
- Endpoints for authorization, token, and userinfo.
