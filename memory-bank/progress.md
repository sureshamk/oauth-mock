# Progress: Mock Google OAuth2 Server

## What Works

Based on the `README.md` and file structure, the following components are in place and should be functional:

- The Docker container setup (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`).
- The Node.js/Express.js server (`index.js`, `package.json`).
- The basic OAuth2 endpoints (`/auth`, `/token`, `/userinfo`).
- The login page (`views/login.ejs`).
- Configuration for mock users and clients (`config/users.json`, `config/clients.json`).

The server should be runnable and able to service basic OAuth2 requests for a client application.

## What's Left to Build

The project appears to be functionally complete for its stated purpose as a mock server. There are no obvious features that are missing for its core use case.

Potential future work could include:
- Adding more complex OAuth2 scenarios (e.g., refresh tokens, different grant types).
- Adding more detailed logging.
- Creating a more extensive test suite.

## Recent Improvements
- The user interface of the login page has been improved with CSS.
- The test cases have been fixed and are all passing.

## Current Status

The project is in a stable, usable state for local development and testing.

## Known Issues

There are no known issues at this time.
